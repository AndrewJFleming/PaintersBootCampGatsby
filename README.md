## Description

Remake of Painter's Bootcamp Blog; New version built with WordPress and Gatsby.

### Help

- Static pages should be set for the homepage and the posts page in the WordPress dashboard's Reading Settings section. Gatsby is setup to print out the list of blog posts on "/posts/" so be sure that the page set as your blog posts page has "posts" as it's slug.
- slider.js is populating it's carousel with images found in the homeSlider folder within the images directory.
